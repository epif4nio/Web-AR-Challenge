# AR Challenge

This demo was developed with 2 goals in mind:

* trying the [ar.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) library
* making a simple "game" where people had to identify 3 objects (this was actually use in a tech event)

# How to use it

1. Copy everything to a web host
2. Print the markers (in directory 'marker_img') or display them on your pc 
3. Access your web site from your phone's browser (firefox or chrome) and allow it to access the camera
4. Point your phone's camera to the markers and try to guess what the objects are (you can check the credits below to check if you're right)
